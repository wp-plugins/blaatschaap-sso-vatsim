This plugin allows your users to sign in with VATSIM. VATSIM uses a modified OAuth protocol. The modifications cause the generic OAuth plugin not to work. This plugin is a modified version to work with VATSIM SSO only.

== Description ==


The VATSIM plugin for WordPress allows you to provide authentication against VATSIM SSO.


== Installation ==

Plugins are usually installed through the WordPress admin panel, which is
an automated process. If manual installation is desired, extract the archive
and upload the files and directories to
/path/to/your/webroot/wp-content/plugins/

== Changelog ==
0.4 :

Based on the BlaatSchaap SSO: OAuth 0.4 codebase. The generic OAuth library is replaced by a library specific for use with VATSIM SSO.
